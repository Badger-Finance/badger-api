# PICKLE Serverless API

Collection of serverless API to enable public access to data surrounding the PICKLE protocol.

## Documentation

Swagger is used for documentation of the Pickle API.
Two sets of hosted swagger documents are currently available: 

- [Brining Documentation](http://brining-docs.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)
- [Production Documentation](https://docs.pickle-jar.info/)

Brining documentation will have latest, in development API and will not be curated.
This document makes no assurances it is accurate, a valid swagger doc, or otherwise not polluted with OPTIONS documentation.
Production documentation will be curated with manual post processing of the Swagger JSON to ensure readibility.
This document will capture the current production deployment of the API with guaranteed testable sandbox.

### Jar Options 

Jar path parameters are case sensitive and based on existing jar contracts.
